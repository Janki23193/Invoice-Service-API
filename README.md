3)using request body,fields are given and selected Json and Post method
4) if it's successful then used to give the response based on request.
5) Check H2 console whether data is installed successfully by going on URL:- http://localhost:9191/h2-console/login.jsp?jsessionid=fc3a8539b1f2f3c0b1717f3a372f859a for checking   creditnote database table and hit connect to see the table created with inserted values.
